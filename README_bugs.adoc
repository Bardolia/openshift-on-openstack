== Stack is stuck in DELETE_IN_PROGRESS

It should not take more than few minutes to delete a stack. There is couple of
operations done for each node on delete:

* existing pods are evacuated from OpenShift nodes
* each node is unregistered with subscription-manager

These operations are represented by `deployment_*_cleanup` Software Deployments
in heat templates for each type of node and are executed by
`os-collect-config` service. Heat waits for finishing cleanup script
on each node until heat-agent sends signal back to Heat that the script has
finished. If the script is not executed or gets stuck for some reason (e.g.
os-collect-config service is not running on `bastion` host or
`bastion` host has been deleted), then Heat timeouts
when waiting on the signal from heat-agent. You can check
`journalctl -u os-collect-config` on `bastion` host for details, if it doesn't
help you can manually send signal for the hanging resource:

```
$ # check what resources are in progress
$ heat resource-list -n 2 mystack|grep PROGRESS

```

In the above output we can see two deployment_bastion_node_cleanup resources.
We can send signal manually by:

```
$ # heat resource-signal <parent_stack_name> <resource_name>
$ heat resource-signal mystack-openshift_infra_nodes-v4p5h5354avk-0-a3ieqspeho2m deployment_bastion_node_cleanup
$ heat resource-signal mystack-openshift_masters-bum3pew2mbex-0-jfs2liw5l3yq deployment_bastion_node_cleanup
```

This command works when the stack is in DELETE_IN_PROGRESS state. If it's in
DELETE_FAILED then run `heat stack-delete mystack` at first.
